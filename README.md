### Hi there! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my degree at Drexel University and moving into a new apartment.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about reference librarianship and data curation, the long history of Fiesta dishware, and the origins of PC Music. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on writing, recipe sharing, and spending time in the sun.

- I explored some fun topics on GitHub for Week 2 in INFO 591. 
- The first topic I explored is [transgender](https://github.com/topics/transgender)
- The second topic I explored is [data-curation](https://github.com/topics/data-curation)
I found really interesting datasets that I will probably reference in the future.
